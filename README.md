# Picocrypt

## How do I install these casks?

For those who are interested in installing the release builds:

```bash
brew tap vraravam/picocrypt
brew install picocrypt
```

Since the app is not signed by an Apple Developer key, you will need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt?tab=readme-ov-file#macos) to unquarantine it

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
